SWAPPING CONTRACT

Swapping Contract is used to swap one token for another in a Decentralized Exchange.
The contract used ISWAPROUTER from the uniswap library to perform the swaps on Uniswap.

Description ðŸ“Œ
* This project is called SWAPPING and it is intended to replicate and understand the 
  working of Swaps in a Decentralized Exchange.
* It uses the uniswap library to create a swapping application.
*	Swapping basically is used to swap one token for another, using liquidity pools.
* In a Swap we provide a certain amount of Token A and in return we get an equivalent amount of Token B.
* Swapping can be of two types
    Single Swap and
    Multi-Hop Swap
    
* A Single Swap is the exchange of tokens using a single Liquidity pool.
* In a Muti-Hop Swap the exchange of tokens occurs using multiple Liquidity pools.
